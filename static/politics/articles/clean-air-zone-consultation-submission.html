The health of the people who live in B&amp;NES must be at the heart of any solution to this air quality problem.</p><p>The fact is, it’s ordinary working people that are most affected by poor air quality. The social housing on Snow Hill sits at the very heart of the proposed Clean Air Zone, and it’s those families that have taken the brunt of the noxious fumes so far. This is not the pet project of a few middle class Bathonians pricing out the less well off in NES from driving into the city. It is the lived and toxic reality for many working people and children.</p><p>It should also be noted that, in actual fact, modelling has shown minimal expected traffic displacement in the authority.</p><p>And so, whilst it’s easy to see the proposed Class D measures as forcing low-income people to spend money they don’t have paying regular charges for driving in the city (or replacing their car with a newer, less polluting, model) it will be those same people who will suffer most if no action is taken.</p><p>The introduction of a Clean Air Zone should ideally meet the following criteria:</p><ol><li>Reduce emissions below the legal target</li><li>Not just shift the air quality problems into other areas</li><li>Place minimal additional burden on low-income people</li><li>Be based on evidence and comprehensive modelling</li></ol><p>To that effect, I have submitted the following to B&amp;NES Council’s public consultation: that research should be conducted into, and modelling produced for, the feasibility of using combinations of the following measures in conjunction with a Class C zone, for an easier transition from older diesel vehicles:</p><ol><li>Introducing a £2000 scrappage scheme (funded by central government) for non-compliant cars.</li><li>Staggering entry into the CAZ through the use of traffic lights, to disrupt idling patterns.</li><li>Greater provision of bus routes, and reduced fares for schools and low income workers.</li><li>The introduction of safe and segregated cycle lanes, and additional cycling infrastructure.</li><li>Additional Clean Air Zones rolled out across the authority.</li><li>The pedestrianisation of Milsom Street.</li></ol><p>If a Class D system is necessary, a bidding system for 1 day a week without incurring charges, for people to plan regular hospital appointment days, etc. should be considered.</p><p>But if this is not feasible, for the protection of the respiratory health of all local residents, the Class D zone should be supported regardless.</p></div></div>
